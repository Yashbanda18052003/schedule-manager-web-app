            👋 About Me
        </h4>
        <p>
            Hey there, I’m Banda Yash. I'm someone who enjoys building things that help people in simple ways.
            I love working on small projects like this web app to improve my skills and create something useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy learning Python, creating web apps, and I'm also a big fan of anime. Apart from coding, I like experimenting with AI tools and thinking about ways to turn ideas into something real.

            🛠️ About the Schedule Reminder App
        </h4>
        <p>
            This is a simple web app I built to help manage daily schedules. You can add your tasks, set reminders, and edit or delete them anytime.
            I built it using Flask and Python as part of my learning journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal with this app was to make something clean and easy to use, so you don't forget the things that matter.
